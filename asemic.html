   <p>Asemic writing, through its form and structure, can intimate a type of document and thus hint at meaning. This illegible style, frequently calligraphic, either parasitises a reader's knowledge of writing systems for comprehension or is understood through (anti)aesthetic (non)sense. Genuine asemic works occur when the creator cannot decipher their own asemic writing. It is a creative production that paradoxically retreats the more that it proliferates. Moderately asemic writing includes natural writing systems legible to some but not all (e.g., codes, stylised scripts). Most asemic writing falls between these extremes. Influences include indecipherable, invented, or primal scripts like wall paintings, scribbles, primitive divination, witch marks, broken runes, or children's attempts. Rather than imitating preliterate expression, asemic writing embodies a global postliterate style drawing inspiration broadly. Other influences are exotic languages in sci-fi, artistic argots, symbols, unsolved scripts, lingua ignota, and street art. Uses include catalysing mental and creative ideas, wordless communication, contemplation, hoax, overcoming writer's block, privacy, secrecy, subterfuge, and the liberatory potentialities of general authorial uncertainty.</p>
