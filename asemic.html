   <h2 class="text-border3"><b>This system can be used for subversive purposes.</b>Because asemic writing doesn't adhere to any established language 
     system, it can be used to convey messages that are hidden from those who don't understand the code. This can be seen as a political act, as it 
     allows for communication outside of the dominant power structures.
     <br>
     <br>
    <b>Asemic writing can challenge the status quo of language and communication.</b>By creating a new form of language, asemic writing can be seen as a 
     challenge to the established norms and hierarchies of communication. This can be seen as a political act, as it disrupts the way that power is 
     exercised through language.
     <br>
     <br>
     <b>The interpretation of asemic writing can be subjective and open to multiple interpretations.</b>This can be seen as a political act, as it challenges 
     the idea of a single, objective truth and instead allows for the possibility of multiple perspectives.

  <div class="right-column text-element padded-paragraph3"> <p> Asemic writing, through its form and structure, can intimate a type of document and thus hint at meaning. 
    This illegible style, frequently calligraphic, either parasitises a reader's knowledge of writing systems 
     for comprehension or is understood through (anti)aesthetic (non)sense. Genuine asemic works occur when the 
     creator cannot decipher their own asemic writing. It is a creative production that paradoxically retreats 
     the more that it proliferates. Moderately asemic writing includes natural writing systems legible to some 
     but not all (e.g., codes, stylised scripts). Most asemic writing falls between these extremes.
    <br>
    Influences include indecipherable, invented, or primal scripts like wall paintings, scribbles, primitive divination, 
     witch marks, broken runes, or children's attempts. Rather than imitating preliterate expression, asemic 
     writing embodies a global postliterate style drawing inspiration broadly. Other influences are exotic 
     languages in sci-fi, artistic argots, symbols, unsolved scripts, lingua ignota, and street art. Uses 
     include catalysing mental and creative ideas, wordless communication, contemplation, hoax, overcoming 
     writer's block, privacy, secrecy, subterfuge, and the liberatory potentialities of general authorial 
     uncertainty.</p>
