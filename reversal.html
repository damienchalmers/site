  <p>The transition to digital and post-cinematic media has precipitated a decoupling of moving images from human 
    subjectivity and perspective. Though we still view and process images related to the cinematic era, this media 
    is now mediated in subtle ways that erode the perceived distance and relationship between viewers as 
    phenomenological subjects and onscreen objects as perceptual objects. The once tangible sense of perspective 
    distance, the space between subjective viewer and viewed object, has been distorted. In short, digitisation 
    has quietly corrupted the visual language of traditional cinema that tethered images to human vantage points. 
    Thus, while retaining a semblance of cinema's imagery, the digitised moving image diverges from human 
    situatedness and veers into non-human territories yet-to-be-accounted-for. Our visual embodiments no longer 
    align with the visual data streaming before our eyes. Moving images float free of embodied people in 
    physical spaces, their meaning adrift.

As 'Reversal' perpetually cycles both forward and backward through the entire 360 degree color spectrum, 
    the artwork immerses viewers in a radically non-representational digitality severed from human subjectivity. 
    In so doing, the work's dissociative images underline the loss of grounded perspective and agency in our 
    post-cinematic age, perhaps signaling greater public vulnerability to external control.

Though ‘Reversal’ echoes cinema’s visual flow, its endless colour wheel immerses viewers in a hypnotic yet 
    disembodied space. In severing ties to reference and representation, the artwork traps attention 
    in an economy dictated by the algorithmic loop. Unable to orient in the revolving spectra, subjects lose 
    footing in phenomenological reality. 

This induces a loss of agency in ascribing significance and crafting meaning from the cascading colours. The work 
    undermines the viewer's authority over their senses and capacity for critical thinking. Consequently, detached 
    from internal anchors of subjectivity, the viewer becomes more vulnerable to projected external narratives and 
    ideologies that can subliminally hunt via the logic of the senses. 

This reveals how digital media threatens to deprive society of sovereignty over its reality, leaving the post-cinematic 
    public susceptible to ideological programming and control through hypnotically discorrelated images.

‘Reversal’ reflects the political economic context that spawned such disembodied media. The privatisation of 
    perception dovetails with the neoliberal logic of recent decades. As public goods and spaces disappeared into 
    private hands, so too has the territorialisation of consciousness and the sensory commons accelerated. The 
    outsourcing of subjective orientation to algorithmic activities parallels the depletion of communal ties and 
    institutional palisades against all-encompassing markets. Like climate change and the financialisation of 
    healthcare, the post-cinematic unmooring of images from human perspective grew from the assumptions underscoring 
    late capitalism. 

Works like ‘Reversal’ emerge as artistic warnings from the future portending what awaits once collective agency 
    fully dissolves into market forces and data flows. The piece reveals a experiential realm where citizens lack 
    the phenomenological tools necessary to challenge hypercommercialised political spaces or to even recognise 
    rights once held sacred.</p>
