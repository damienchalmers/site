    <p>Hartnett seeks to bring an ever-complexifying world into the framework of cognition using multimedia visual communication. The works are
    self-organising which variably means that the authorship of the work is dispersed within the idea of it. The outcome is often to imagine 
    new social realities.</p>
 <br>
  <p>Ideas that are now commonplace in contemporary art—communication, social interaction, engaged audiences, and self-direction—have long been 
    at the core of his groundbreaking multimedia projects. Situating his pioneering, nonlinear practice at the intersection of art and fields like 
    cybernetics, advertising, systems analysis, learning theory, communications theory, and computer technology, he has cultivated a collaborative, 
    interactive, participatory approach rooted in simulating subjective experience through audience involvement with the fluid variables of social 
    connections, contexts, and tangible realities. Rather than providing reductive, feedforward resolution, his work allows for emergence and 
    self-organisation to occur, embracing black box thinking. Instead of showing guests fixed symbols that lead to foregone conclusions, he assembles 
    chaotic, multifaceted spaces that spark visitors’ imagination and prompt them to tap into their own inventive abilities in an open-ended fashion. 
    His style stands in contrast to more traditional linear, cause-and-effect reasoning that pursues definative answers.</p>

  <p class="padded-paragraph3 text-border">Our work can be decribed in the following terms:
  <br>
    Time-based - Projects necessitating prolonged spectatorship (e.g. video, performance, new media)  viewer engagement within a controled setting.
    <br>
    <br>
    Non-sequential - Works allow potential reconfiguration (with or without interaction); recombinant poetics.
 <br>
    <br>
    Real-time - Works utilise instantaneous communication (e.g. live feeds, social media, theatre, protest, weather systems, market forces) or self-assemble spontaneously.
 <br>
    <br>
    Organised – Activities that are primitive and natural. Arenas for the execrise of attention; seeing, listening, doing, undergoing, praxis, action.
 <br>
    <br>
    Algorithmic - Necessitates software literacy regarding programming principles.
 <br>
    <br>
    Automated - Requires comprehending the equilibrium between creativity and programmability.
 <br>
    <br>
    Interactive - New media mandates apprehending responsiveness as a medium.
 <br>
    <br>
    Emergent - Works arising from complex systems with simple rules, emphasising decentralised organisation.
 <br>
    <br>
    Collective - Collaborative projects with shared authorship, investigating social dynamics, economies of scale and collective intelligence.  </p>

<h2>The key ideas embodied in the term ‘recombinant poetics’ bring together different elements, often through digital means, 
  to create new poetic forms, textures, and meanings. The alternative terms try to capture that spirit of mechanically or 
  digitally combining disparate components to synthesise something innovative. ‘Generative’, ‘computational’, and ‘algorithmic’ 
  poetics place more emphasis on automated processes, while terms likes ‘remixed,’ ‘hybrid,’ and ‘chimeric’ poetics evoke manual 
  splicing and dicing. But they all suggest avant-garde writing practices that subvert traditional modes through unusual recombinancy.
