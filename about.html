    <p>Hartnett seeks to bring an ever-complexifying world into the framework of cognition using multimedia visual communication.</p>
 <br>
  <p>Our work can be decribed in the following terms:</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Time-based - Projects necessitating prolonged spectatorship (e.g. video, performance, new media)  viewer engagement within a controled setting.
    <br>
    <br>
    Non-sequential - Works allow potential reconfiguration (with or without interaction); recombinant poetics.
 <br>
    <br>
    Real-time - Works utilise instantaneous communication (e.g. live feeds, social media, theatre, protest, weather systems, market forces) or self-assemble spontaneously.
 <br>
    <br>
    Organised – Activities that are primitive and natural. Arenas for the execrise of attention; seeing, listening, doing, undergoing, praxis, action.
 <br>
    <br>
    Algorithmic - Necessitates software literacy regarding programming principles.
 <br>
    <br>
    Automated - Requires comprehending the equilibrium between creativity and programmability.
 <br>
    <br>
    Interactive - New media mandates apprehending responsiveness as a medium.
 <br>
    <br>
    Emergent - Works arising from complex systems with simple rules, emphasising decentralised organisation.
 <br>
    <br>
    Collective - Collaborative projects with shared authorship, investigating social dynamics, economies of scale and collective intelligence.  </p>
  <br>
    <br>

The key ideas embodied in the term ‘recombinant poetics’ bring together different elements, often through digital means, 
  to create new poetic forms, textures, and meanings. The alternative terms try to capture that spirit of mechanically or 
  digitally combining disparate components to synthesise something innovative. ‘Generative’, ‘computational’, and ‘algorithmic’ 
  poetics place more emphasis on automated processes, while terms likes ‘remixed,’ ‘hybrid,’ and ‘chimeric’ poetics evoke manual 
  splicing and dicing. But they all suggest avant-garde writing practices that subvert traditional modes through unusual recombinancy.
