    <p>Hartnett seeks to bring an ever-complexifying world into the framework of cognition using multimedia visual communication. The works are
    self-organising which variably means that the authorship of the work is dispersed within the idea of it. The outcome is often to imagine 
    different social realities and new epistemologies.</p>
 <br>
  <p>Situating their nonlinear practice at the intersection of art and fields like cybernetics, advertising, systems analysis, learning theory, 
    communications theory, complex systems theory, and computer technology, Hartnett has cultivated a collaborative, interactive, participatory 
    approach rooted in simulating subjective experience through audience engagement with the fluid variables of social connections, contexts, 
    and tangible realities always at play. Rather than providing reductive, feed-forward resolution, their work allows for emergence and self-organisation, 
    embracing emergent black box thinking and toy theorems. Their calculatedly indefinite approach stands in contrast to more traditional art historical 
    processes that fetishise linear, cause-and-effect reasoning to pursue definitive answers and conclusions. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The work of Hartnett is an infected abstraction, a creeping intrusion of alien conjecture into logic, an encroachment of theory that fundamentally 
      alters the framework of decision-making beyond simple binary choices.</p>

    Time-based - Projects necessitating prolonged spectatorship (e.g. video, performance, new media)  viewer engagement within a controled setting.
    <br>
    <br>
    Non-sequential - Works allow potential reconfiguration (with or without interaction); recombinant poetics.
 <br>
    <br>
    Real-time - Works utilise instantaneous communication (e.g. live feeds, social media, theatre, protest, weather systems, market forces) or self-assemble spontaneously.
 <br>
    <br>
    Organised – Activities that are primitive and natural. Arenas for the execrise of attention; seeing, listening, doing, undergoing, praxis, action.
 <br>
    <br>
    Algorithmic - Necessitates software literacy regarding programming principles.
 <br>
    <br>
    Automated - Requires comprehending the equilibrium between creativity and programmability.
 <br>
    <br>
    Interactive - New media mandates apprehending responsiveness as a medium.
 <br>
    <br>
    Emergent - Works arising from complex systems with simple rules, emphasising decentralised organisation.
 <br>
    <br>
    Collective - Collaborative projects with shared authorship, investigating social dynamics, economies of scale and collective intelligence.

<h2>The key ideas embodied in the term ‘recombinant poetics’ bring together different elements, often through digital means, 
  to create new poetic forms, textures, and meanings. The alternative terms try to capture that spirit of mechanically or 
  digitally combining disparate components to synthesise something innovative. ‘Generative’, ‘computational’, and ‘algorithmic’ 
  poetics place more emphasis on automated processes, while terms likes ‘remixed,’ ‘hybrid,’ and ‘chimeric’ poetics evoke manual 
  splicing and dicing. But they all suggest avant-garde writing practices that subvert traditional modes through unusual recombinancy.
