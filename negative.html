<div class="text-element"><p>As a productive activity the work of the NB is an investigation into palliative anti-psychiatry and the emergent effects of collective intelligence through the prism of therapeutic photography and creative engagement within and without an acute inpatient mental health facility. The project was deployed tentatively in 2022/23 post-pandemic. Updates will follow pending uptake of participation. </p></div>

<p>
Part of the larger Collective Sigh project, Negative Bloc is a contribution to investigating cybernetic depression and artificial suffering in the human and machine. The intention is to reify the somewhat abstracted and opaque relationship we have to the depressogenic technologies of contemporaneity in order to clarify mitigation tactics.</p>
