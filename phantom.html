  <div class="text-element"><p>After post-structuralism's fixation on self-propagating signs, we must conceive an alternative framework. If everything symbolises a symbol under capitalist realism, resistance entails negating the system by embodying its absence - the void around which it orbits. Like a building's negative space, this generative emptiness defines structure. As raw needs cooked, concepts require opposites. Inventions yield new accidents – cars and crashes, ships and wrecks. Driverless cars invent drivers' disappearance. Information emerges in absence - smart devices learning from empty rooms. Blast shadows expose victims by their lack.

Systems and structures often define themselves in relation to something that is absent or missing. Just as a building is structured around the empty spaces and rooms inside, systems can be organised around a central cavity or gap.

For example, in Claude Levi-Strauss's analysis of culinary systems, the notion of "the raw" only makes sense in opposition to "the cooked." The two concepts imply and require each other. Technologies also tend to bring into being their own negation - as Paul Virilio argued, the invention of new modes of transit simultaneously invents new forms of accident.

Contemporary systems still exhibit this paradoxical reliance on the negative. As Joi Ito points out, driverless cars do not simply automate driving tasks - they fundamentally reimagine the very notion of a driver. Their design hinges on the absence of human oversight and action. We might say the system invents a new kind of "driverless space" in which the driver is defined by their non-existence.

This points to a radical truth about systems, signs, and structures - they require a hollow, a gap where something ought to be but is not, in order to operate. Their integrity as coherent systems depends on dealing with this negative space. Challenging and undermining dominant structures may therefore hinge on strategically targeting, widening and stressing this underlying indeterminacy or ontological lack which paradoxically grounds their functioning. This space of uncertainty and absence acts as both their condition of possibility and their point of weakness. Locating and leveraging this negative space is where the deepest radical potentials perhaps reside.

In this way, dominant structures carry the seeds of their own unraveling - their absent center functions as both foundation and abyss, order and weakness. By operating from and accentuating this lack, systems can be profoundly challenged and transformed.

This absence is the proletariat, capitalism's core vacancy - not warring factions but the structure and its hollow. Repellant negativity thus makes the proletariat the revolutionary class, ever-revolting. Transforming inequality requires its collective hand. We must connect emergent knowledge to ethics and possibilities of resistance.

If adaptationism wrongly aligns our technologies with evolution, then primal creative engagement with nature is the uncorrupted past. We back into a future amidst the wreckage, constellating meaning from accumulated debris - shrapnel of capitalism’s conflicts, shattered actions and hauntological never-to-becomes, all intimating our position.

Like film’s cutting room floors betraying excised arcs, immaterial labour’s ghosts enable success by failing through complexity’s silent evidence. Strategic investigations into authorless production via creative dispersion recoup unaccounted surplus value from invisible zero-hour work. We must diagnose the underlying conditions and recallibrtate power structures to redistribute excess from the privileged few to the many below.

The void defines. Discomfort intimates resistance to representation’s naivety. “Anyone could do that” exposes the generative absence within. Irrationality liberates, destratifying binaries through the post-conceptual subject’s endless deterritorialisation. Never concluding, abstraction begins the negative’s work.

It is in the spirit of harnessing the negative space that we wish to explore anomalies and gaps in image formation. In the abstracted data of an alphanumeric hexdump there emerges an unintended aesthetic. Moiré patterns too exhibit shifting landscapes that undermine direct representation, conjuring an absence that pushes identification beyond binary poles. The glitch is a vicious precursor to difference and may intimate at an absent intersticial territory with no map. In non-image forming light, possibilities swell and collapse, escaping neat stratification, subject only to mad photonic impulse.

As Benjamin Bratton argues, information can also paradoxically stem from avoidance and emptiness. A smart thermostat gleans as much from absence as presence - learning from when inhabitants are away. For such ambient sensors, non-interaction informs as much as interaction. Likewise, the very lack of discernible image or meaning in certain contemporary art expression intimates the message the work seeks to convey. The frustration one feels in facing a blank canvas underscores the attempted escape from familiar modes of representation. So rather than dismiss such work as empty, we might recognise in that judgment the very reaction the art aims to provoke.

To break from reductive binary thinking, to deterritorialise decision-making, the post-conceptual artist embraces the feral and uncontained. Forensic Architecture similarly leverages negation in its spatial analyses - using blast patterns and fragmentation traces to map not only visible destruction, but absence. The missing bodies, the blank spaces where people would have absorbed shrapnel, become ghosts in the data, presences defined by their very lack.

In all such cases, the negative space shapes the system's possibilities as much as any visible components. Absence parodoxically structures and destructures; it is both generative void and destabilising abyss. The radical potency of these gaps and hollows lies precisely in unraveling binaries – neither solely presence nor absence, they undo categorical thought itself. To irrationaly compel reconsideration, to dismantle the hegemony of representation, the provocative power of the undecidable negative beckons.
