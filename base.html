  <div class="right-column text-element"> <p>Base Money is a generative artwork that visualises the complex interplay between economic ideas and the values that shape society.
At the core of the piece is an algorithmically stochastic (a random probability distribution that exhibits statistical regularities allowing analysis but not affording precise prediction) system representing a simplified economy, with ersatz quantitative easing dynamically injecting base money.
    <br>
    <br>
   Flowing throughout this system are digital 'citizens' initiating () an injection () of new money, allowing them to speculatively participate in, and visualise exchanges within, the other economy.
The interactions and distributions in the system aim to raise questions about what money actually is and how implementing #ubd policies could impact inequality, hierarchy, and social cohesion in the community.
 <br>
    <br>
    Viewers are prompted to consider perspectives on human dignity, counterfeit, protest, fair compensation for different types of labor, MMT and the role and motivation of elites in preserving status quo values versus more equitable realities.

If money is viewed as a system of access tokens embedded within a network of relationships, this project is a provocation that aligns with the statement: consensus alone confers value.
