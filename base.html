  <div class="right-column text-element"> <p>Base Money is a generative artwork that visualises the complex interplay between economic ideas and the values that shape society.
At the core of the piece is an algorithmically stochastic (a random probability distribution that exhibits statistical regularities allowing analysis but not affording precise prediction) system representing a simplified economy, with ersatz quantitative easing dynamically injecting base money.
    <br>
    <br>
   Flowing throughout this system are digital 'citizens' initiating an injection of new money, allowing them to speculatively participate in, and visualise exchanges within, the other economy.
The interactions and distributions in the system aim to raise questions about what money actually is and how implementing #ubd policies could impact inequality, hierarchy, and social cohesion in the community.
 <br>
    <br>
    Viewers are prompted to consider perspectives on human dignity, counterfeit, protest, fair compensation for different types of labor, MMT and the role and motivation of elites in preserving status quo values versus more equitable realities.

If money is viewed as a system of access tokens embedded within a network of relationships, this project is a provocation that aligns with the statement: consensus alone confers value.

      The piece plays with notions of academic abstraction versus practical reality when modeling financial systems.</h2></div>

    <h2 class="text-border">Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) challenges conventional macroeconomic beliefs by proposing that financially sovereign nations—like 
    the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada—operating with full control over their fiat currencies, face no operational constraints on federal spending tied to 
    revenues.<br>
<br>
In simpler terms, MMT asserts that these governments, as monopoly issuers of their currency, don't need to rely on taxes or borrowing to fund expenditures; 
    they can essentially <b><u>print money as required</u></b>. Unlike household budgets, their policies need not be driven by concerns about increasing 
    national debt.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, MMT distinguishes itself from mainstream monetary theory through various aspects, with a key difference being the sequence of events stemming 
    from loans and deposits, as well as government spending and taxes.</h2>
