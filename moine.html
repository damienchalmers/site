  <div class="text-element"><p>The first of an investigation into Moine Mhòr Nature Reserve. 
    A series of photographs as placeholders for the concept. This project delineates our paradoxical, hypermodern 
    condition and provides steps towards a new theory addressing the complexity of the hybrid, 
    networked image intimating at an emancipatory ‘bogland’ politics. Photographic ontologies and the 
    attendant affilation to historically fixed representational thinking must be buried in order to 
    comprehend and engage the contemporary default of the computational image. 
<br>
    <br>
The project contends that the dominant language and thinking of photography now conceals the new conditions of network culture and the computational image. 
    Traditional photography must be challenged moving beyond its residual influence to understand contemporary capitalism, inequality, and climate crisis. 
    This requires critiquing academic discourse on photography, which tends towards isolating it conceptually, towards developing a transdisciplinary, 
    accessible visual culture and distributed knowledge project.
<br>
    <br>
    ...
    <br>
    <br>
We have used the traditional medium of photography, particularly the landscape vernacular, to describe the conditions that would seek to deconstruct tradition, 
    dismantling convention through photogenic customs and photographic mechanics. As an open, publically accessible, offline platform, Moine Mhòr 
    Nature Reserve must be viewed as an operating system of collapse in the midst of incalculable failure, circumventing the isolating and reductive 
    tendencies of academic discourse on image and identity. Instead, it facilitates a transdisciplinary visual culture, teeming with potentialities, 
    attuned to the complexity of climate crisis and the contemporary computational image. 
<br>
    <br>
The site and medium are important tools to wreck convention. Taking it (photography) apart through the mechanics of its own making by showing the trace 
    of a monster in the negative of its shadow. Moine Mhòr is an effort to understand something by observing and analysing only its impacts and consequences, 
    without directly accessing or seeing the thing itself. These propaedeutic works will form a constellation that, when viewed as a whole, function as an 
    emergent explicandum yet-to-be.</p></div>
