Medium Format employs traditional landscape photography to challenge photographic conventions and representational thinking. It explores our hypermodern condition, proposing a new theory for the embeddedness of networked, computational images. The project critiques the representationally fetishistic  academic discourse on photography, advocating for a radically transdisciplinary approach to absorbing visual culture. 
Moine Mh√≤r Nature Reserve is an operating system. Thinking through, with, about, and beyond this land activates ecological thought. As an open, protected, and public space, it serves as a microcosm for deliberating global crises. It offers a platform to reimagine, through the attendant bogland politics, identities and solutions beyond restrictive narratives, addressing climate change, inequality, and geopolitical challenges.
By deconstructing photographic traditions, the series aims to reveal the complexities of our current visual paradigm and its societal implications by covertly using the language of photography to capture something in a feral light by observing and analysing only its impacts and consequences, without directly accessing or seeing the thing itself. The site and medium are important tools to wreck convention. Taking photography apart through the mechanics of its own making by showing the trace of a monster in the negative of its shadow.
