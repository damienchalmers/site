  <div class="text-element"><p>These photographs are placeholders for the concept. Moine Mhòr delineates our paradoxical, hypermodern condition and 
    provides steps towards a new theory addressing the complexity of the hybrid, networked image intimating at an emancipatory ‘bogland’ politics. 
    Photographic ontologies and the attendant affilation to historically fixed representational thinking must be buried in order to comprehend and 
    engage the contemporary default of the computational image. 
<br>
    <br>
The project contends that the dominant language and thinking of photography now conceals the new conditions of network culture and the computational image. 
    Traditional photography must be challenged moving beyond its residual influence to understand contemporary capitalism, inequality, and climate crisis. 
    This requires critiquing academic discourse on photography, which tends towards isolating it conceptually, and developing a transdisciplinary, 
    accessible visual culture and distributed knowledge project.
<br>
    <br>
    Ansel Adams' photographs exemplify a traditional photographic style focused on faithfully reproducing reality. This represents an ontological 
    view of photography as fixed representation. Post-conceptual computational/digital photography challenges this as images become open to manipulation. 
    Radically open. Now I view the Adams family of photographs as a terror on the timeline. Shut ins. This is a bad remake. The decisional horror of this or that. 
    An always-already digital ouroboros that ends up back at binary logic regardless of the start or end point. Are we destined to open the door to the room that we 
    thought we just exited?
<br>
    <br>
Paradoxically exhumed by the act of being interred, zombie photography must be diagnosed through analysing the stratified layers from which its record 
    emerges. Photograph as fossilised symptom. Discovering the fossil evinces the rhizomatic image which is always-already latent in its binary carapace. 
    Once the exoskeleton of certainty is shattered new possibilities assemble.
<br>
    <br>
We have used the traditional medium of photography and landscape vernacular to describe the conditions that would seek to deconstruct tradition, 
    dismantling convention through photogenic customs and photographic mechanics. The Moine Mhòr site and its digital medium provide critical tools 
    for challenging and moving beyond traditional photography's residual influence. As an open, publically accessible, offline platform, Moine Mhòr 
    Nature Reserve must be viewed as an operating system of collapse in the midst of incalculable failure, circumventing the isolating and reductive 
    tendencies of academic discourse on image and identity. Instead, it facilitates a transdisciplinary visual culture, teeming with potentialities, 
    attuned to the complexity of climate crisis and the contemporary computational image. 
<br>
    <br>
The site and medium are important tools to wreck convention. Taking it (photography) apart through the mechanics of its own making by showing the trace 
    of a monster in the negative of its shadow. Moine Mhòr is an effort to understand something by observing and analysing only its impacts and consequences, 
    without directly accessing or seeing the thing itself. These propaedeutic works will form a constellation that, when viewed as a whole, function as an 
    emergent explicandum yet-to-be.</p></div>
