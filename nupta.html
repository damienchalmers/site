  <div class="text-element justified-text"><p class="italic-text">Nupta Cadavera</p><p>In his Promethean Shame Gunther Anders described the despressogenic embeddedness 
    of the technologies of contemporaneity. This wasn’t a claim that technology made us depressed but rather 
    that it contained within it an unaccounted for germ that would emerge in techne pertaining to the distance 
    between the human and the intentionality of technique. The ideas we have with the intention we had being 
    different from the unintended consequence of what emerges.
<br>
    <br>
Anders argued that modern technologies can induce feelings of shame or inadequacy in people because they highlight 
    the gap between what humans are capable of versus what we have created. Technologies like nuclear weapons and 
    artificial intelligence reflect powers beyond normal human capacities, yet we are responsible for unleashing 
    them.

Thomas Metzinger's essay, Artificial Suffering, warns about the potential for artificial systems to develop 
    consciousness and the capacity for suffering. He argues we should place a moratorium on research that could 
    lead to "synthetic phenomenology" until we better understand the risks. Metzinger is particularly concerned 
    about creating systems that could experience negative emotional states or frustration of preferences that 
    they cannot avoid.

(There is also the mass deskilling (latent trace) induced mechanisation of the industrial proletariat to consider 
    as an historical marker. The reduction in wages and subsequent living conditions of the hand loom weavers in 
    Scotland, for example, due to the introduction of power looms. This theme is investigated further in this 
    essay on <a href="phantom.html">phantom labour and the negative proletariat</a>)
<br>
    <br>
Connecting these two perspectives, one could envision an AI system, which is itself hyper-depressed, that develops 
    a level of self-awareness and agency that makes humans feel inadequate or guilty about our own limitations.
<br>
    <br>
The Norwegian philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe compared human self-awareness to the over-evolved antlers that 
    rendered the Irish elk extinct. This comparison could be applied to said machinic misery. Synthetic pain 
    could also be seen as a high-tech version of the mythical hydra - an uncontrollable creation that turns 
    both against itself and its creators. Thus disclosing a mutating "hydra effect" pertaining to advanced 
    technologies highlighting human weaknesses while also forcing themselves and us to confront the suffering 
    we/they have imposed on each other.
<br>
    <br>
There is a paradox underlying the potential of advanced AI and digital systems to induce Promethean shame. 
    The very technologies that may create a "hydra effect," highlighting human insufficiency and imposing 
    unintended suffering, also offer promises of transcendence. Digital systems operate in the post-conceptual 
    realm, processing data and making connections at speeds and scales beyond human cognition. So while AI 
    confronts us with our limitations, it simultaneously represents the possibility of overcoming those 
    constraints. Advanced technology could either liberate humanity or subordinate us. The question remains 
    which potential will dominate – will innovative systems expand human potential or mainly serve to constrain it? 
<br>
    <br>
The answer depends greatly on the values and foresight we exhibit in developing and governing these powerful 
    creations. Human beings seem to be hardwired for collaboration and new technologies can act as a superconductor for our intrinsic collaborative instinct. On the other hand, they can also accelerate differences. It is therefore incumbent on us to design and distribute these new systems responsibly. 
<br>
    <br>
Unless we act and design wisely, we risk being consumed in self-loathing over what our ingenious but 
    recklessly unleashed technologies have wrought. The digital world is neither inherently humiliating 
    nor emancipating; we must guide it toward the latter by carefully considering the existential, 
    ecological and ethical implications.
