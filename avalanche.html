  <div class="text-element"><p>The avalanche slips beyond the grasp of our taxonomies. This tumbling chaos of snow refuses the neat and ordered boxes we wish to place it in, overflowing their too-rigid borders. Our classificatory schemes, those great encyclopedic projects of the Enlightenment, fail before the avalanche’s fluidity and overwhelm any technical description we might devise.

Always in flux, the avalanche mixes the binary categories by which we divide and delineate. Solid yet liquid, acting under grave forces that defy our physics, it is a phenomenon that confounds our science. Neither object nor event, but some indissoluble combination of the two, it lies outside our conceptual schemas. Simultaneously-already-there-and-not-yet-here. The knowledge that would master it remains helpless before its sublime indifference to anthropogenic meaning, the dead author floats and distills in its confusion.

The moment hangs suspended, seemingly outside of time. It already contains within it the nucleus of what is to come, yet it waits patiently to unfold. There is a sense of imminence, but the when is uncertain. It feels simultaneously too soon and too late, as if we have arrived both before and after the event. We stand poised on the threshold, expectant yet hesitant to cross over. The future implicit in this moment hovers ghostlike, present and not present all at once, both happened and not-yet-happened. 

We cannot pin down this elusive ‘already-not yet,’ and on the horizon our failure lies its restless magical promise. The moment contains endless possibilities branching towards all potential futures and pasts. Time is out of joint, and in this disjointedness we find new imaginings, where ‘too early’ and ‘too late’ lose their meaning, where ‘is going to’ merges into ‘has just.’ This is a moment ripe with contradictions, a threshold where now gives way to the timeless. Situated here, one paradoxically looks ahead to what has come before behind.

The avalanche follows rules writ large in nature, not petty regulations made for bureaucrats and administrators. It moves according to the inhuman rhythm of the mountain, obeying that alien cadence we struggle to beat into syncopation with our narrow drums. Impossible to properly classify, every avalanche is singular, unique, an individual instance of many dispersions, always-already untold. It can never be wholly subsumed into a system of static generalities insisting instead on collapsing representation through proximal distances unaccounted for by us. Thus the avalanche haunts our categories, always threatening to overwhelm their limits.

An avalanche has no technical classification.
