  <h1>The Book of Sutures</h1>
  <p>By utilising scanned skull sutures as our training dataset, we
developed application software capable of generating written
representations that intentionally disregard any semantic
relationships. The project generates text-like markings that,
although displaying aesthetic qualities, remain devoid of
linguistic meaning. The asemic product is therefore resistant to
any historical precedent and retains no historically derived
significance. Computationally produced sutures, political
vectors from a covert operating system, intimate at a future history of novel signifiers
that effectively dematerialise the signified. This irrational
surplus of unconscious production is an unfiltered communion
from an impersonal creative impulse.</p>

  <p>The book of sutures is a para-literary device and a new form of
signification.</p>
