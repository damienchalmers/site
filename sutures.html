     <p class="text-element justified-text">By utilising scanned skull sutures as our training dataset, we developed application software capable of generating 
    written representations that intentionally disregard any semantic relationships. The project generates text-like markings that, although displaying 
    aesthetic qualities, remain devoid of linguistic meaning. 
<br>
    <br>

  <div class="right-column text-element justified-text"><p>If the hypothetical purpose, the act of ‘reading’ the sagittal suture, is to depict an unusual story of an early social class as told through the human 
    body itself, it shows that we, defined as human subjectivity, have no control over the writing of it. This is a primal engraving that is premised on 
    the disappearance of anthropomorphic hubris. A feral reformatting, a wild scribing, that is present now, though seeming not to belong in the current 
    age, connected instead to an ahistorical anti-subject.
    <br>
    <br>
The asemic product is therefore resistant to any historical precedent and retains no historically derived significance. Computationally produced sutures 
    become political vectors that intimate at a future history of novel signifiers that effectively dematerialise the signified. This irrational surplus 
    of unconscious production is an unfiltered communion from an impersonal creative impulse. 
<br>
    <br>
What breed of teeming epistemologies can this type of writing generate, since it departs so violently from philosophy yet does not amount to rigorous 
    science of any kind? Without the calamitous overthinking and need to precisely portray reality, might it end up as a somewhat deranged style of scrawl, 
    scrittura scadente, forming ephemeral theoretical concepts using fragmentary glimpses of sagittal-sutures-as-embedded-readymades?
<br>
    <br>
The book of sutures is a para-literary device and a new form of
signification.</p>
