  <div class="text-element"><p>By utilising scanned skull sutures as our training dataset, we developed application software capable 
    of generating written representations that intentionally disregard any semantic relationships. The project generates text-like markings that, 
    although displaying aesthetic qualities, remain devoid of linguistic meaning. 
<br>
    <br>
If the hypothetical purpose, the act of ‘reading’ the sagittal suture, is to depict an unusual story of an prototypical social class as told 
    through the human body itself, it shows that we, defined as human subjectivity, have no control over the writing of it. This is a primal 
    engraving that is premised on the disappearance of subjectivity. A feral subject that exists, despite appearing under present circumstances, 
    out of time, a distance measured only by the most ancient past and the most distant future. 
<br>
    <br>
The asemic product is therefore resistant to any historical precedent and retains no historically derived significance. Computationally produced 
    sutures become political vectors that intimate at a future history of novel signifiers that effectively dematerialise the signified. This irrational 
    surplus of unconscious production is an unfiltered communion from an impersonal creative impulse. 
<br>
    <br>
The book of sutures is a para-literary device and a new form of
signification.</p>
