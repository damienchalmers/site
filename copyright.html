  <div class="text-element justified-text"><p class="italic-text">After Copyright</p><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) marks a new era questioning 
    traditional notions of authorship and copyright. As these models demonstrate increasing aptitude for 
    generating coherent text indistinguishable from humans, the concept of the author as the sole font of 
    creative expression becomes untenable. 
<br>
    <br>
Humans do not create in a vacuum. It is now null and void to assume sole authorship over works. It seems that 
    the introduction of more powerful AI systems crystalise the scalar scope of collective intelligence. If an 
    LLM outputs essays, stories and analysis without human guidance, where does authorship lie? The words may 
    have an authorial voice, but they emerge algorithmically from patterns across millions of texts without a 
    singular person behind them.
<br>
    <br>
Just as LLMs diminish sole authorship, they erode the basis for copyright. Copyright depends on works reflecting 
    unique individual expression deserving control over copies and derivatives. But if an LLM amalgamates 
    countless authors' styles and ideas, who deserves ownership over its output? Applying traditional copyright 
    would greatly restrict public access to automated generation.
<br>
    <br>
This reveals the hubris of grasping to sole authorship despite technologies dissolving individual control. 
    Clinging to outdated signs of human exceptionalism against the AI tide will not forestall copyright questions 
    around works without a singular human source. A new paradigm reckoning with the irrelevance of hubristic 
    authorial claims in the age of increasingly powerful generative models is needed. Legal realities and 
    public access must prevail over solipsistic insistence on exclusive ownership where ownership cannot be 
    clearly delineated.
<br>
    <br>
There is obviously historical precedent to the dissolving of assumptions. The origins 
    of early sacred music emerged from church doctrine rather than individual expression. Composers of medieval 
    religious works intentionally obscured their identity, as personal ingenuity was subordinate to representing 
    official aesthetics. Once adopted for liturgical use, compositions no longer reflected an individual but the 
    spiritual identity of the church. It would have seemed presumptuous to claim ownership over communal creative 
    output. Similarly, powerful generative models synthesise linguistic patterns collectively, without a singular 
    authorial voice behind their textual production. Their output echoes the early marginalization of individual 
    ownership over sacred works embraced as representations of institutional ideals. 
<br>
    <br>
We must challenge modern notions of copyright that vaunt individual expression, as AI generation demonstrates 
    the power of collective intelligence exceeding any sole mind. Language models amalgamate vast datasets to 
    stochastically produce novel writings, but there is no one person deserving ownership over their production. 
    Nor should there be an individual or sect benefiting financially it must be stated. As religious doctrine 
    once nullified individual ingenuity within liturgical music to communicate institutional ideals, models 
    derivatively fuse myriad influences in their algorithmic journey toward unprecedented expression. We must 
    relinquish grasping ownership over output emerging from communal wellsprings, whether the church chorus or 
    the machine learning model. Powerful AI compels evolving authorship constructs centered on collective 
    ingenuity rather than individual exceptionalism. The mythic concept of ideas spawned solely within one mind 
    cannot withstand technologies revealing creativity's essential communal origins. 
<br>
    <br>
LLMs also echo even broader originality and ownership questions emerging from automated synthesis technologies. 
    Just as models generate text by recombining patterns without an author, DNA churns out nucleotides by 
    following an algorithmic replicative process without a conscious designer behind the scenes.
<br>
    <br>
Where does originality lie in these automated biological and textual generative processes lacking a human or 
    biological author? The outputs emerge from preprogrammed building blocks interacting stochastically, not 
    intentional singular creativity. This amorphic notion of authorship strains legal assumptions about copyright 
    requiring individual ownership over unique expressions. 
<br>
    <br>
Clinging to outdated romantic signs of exceptional human creativity hardly forestalls dilemmas of authorless 
    originality. As AI and biotech dissolve singular claims to creative ownership, new paradigms must emerge 
    holistically reckoning how novelty reliably springs from algorithmic recombination within automated 
    generative technologies across domains. Legal realities should favour accessibility over individual 
    control for synthetic creativity not clearly attributable to a sole originating mind or organism.
<br>
    <br>
It is perhaps time to rethink creative ownership in the age of automated generation.
